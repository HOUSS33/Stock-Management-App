## 🤖 Introduction

This project is a lightweight **Product Management System** designed to perform full CRUD operations and local data persistence. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and search products with advanced functionality like real-time price calculation, batch entry, chart visualization, and more.

All data is saved in the **browser's localStorage**, so you won't lose your product data even after refreshing or closing the browser tab.
